# Reddit Post for r/SideProject

## Title:
Built my first app - a loan calculator that handles complex payment scenarios (the banks don't show you this)

## Post:

**What I built:** Loan Co-Pilot - a free mobile app for tracking loans and visualizing payoff strategies

**Why I built it:**

A few years ago, I had a $70k loan and became obsessed with trying to figure out the optimal payoff strategy. I spent countless hours in Excel trying to model scenarios like:
- "What if I add a one-time $500 payment in March, start recurring $50 extras in June, and my rate adjusts in September?"
- "Should I pay the high-interest loan first or knock out the small one for motivation?"

Existing calculators either weren't free to fully test, or they couldn't handle the flexibility I needed. I wanted to duplicate a loan and run multiple "what-if" scenarios side by side.

So I built this. It's my first app.

**Key features:**
- Track multiple loans in one place
- Add one-time or recurring extra payments at specific dates
- Model rate adjustments over time
- Compare avalanche vs snowball strategies
- Duplicate loans to test different payment plans (plan A, B, C)
- Visualizations showing principal vs interest breakdown
- Generate PDF reports
- 100% local storage - no accounts, no data collection

**Tech stack:**
- React Native (Expo)
- TypeScript
- AsyncStorage for local persistence
- Live on iOS, Android coming soon

**What I'm looking for:**
- General feedback on the concept and execution
- What am I missing that would make this actually useful?
- UX/UI feedback (I'm a backend dev primarily)
- Is there a market for this kind of tool, or am I solving a problem only I had?
- **Any marketing advice** - I tried posting on r/povertyfinance to get feedback from people who actually need this, but it got removed for being off-topic. How do I reach people who would actually benefit from this tool?

**Status:** Live on IOS app stores, completely free, no ads.

Happy to answer any questions about the build process or the app itself. This is my first mobile app so I'm sure there's plenty I could improve!
