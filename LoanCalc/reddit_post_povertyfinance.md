## Title:
I paid off a $70k loan that jumped from 8% to 10.75% - built a free calculator so you don't have to obsess over Excel like I did

## Post:

Hey everyone,

Hope I'm not breaking any rules - this is my first app and I genuinely just want feedback from people dealing with loans.

A few years ago, I had a $70k personal loan at 8% interest. By 2021, the rate had climbed to 10.75%. I was furious - kept going to the bank to argue about it (spoiler: that didn't work).

I became obsessed with trying to figure out how to kill this loan faster. I built this massive Excel spreadsheet to calculate how extra payments would help, how the Fed rate changes affected me, when I'd actually be free of this thing. I'd spend hours tweaking numbers, trying to find a way out.

Eventually, I paid it off in 2 years through consistent extra payments and selling my car to make a big lump payment. But man, the whole process was exhausting.

**So I built Loan Co-Pilot**

There are other calculators out there and I appreciate that they exist, but most weren't free to fully test, and the ones I could try weren't flexible enough to show how different extra payment strategies worked, or how rate adjustments would actually impact my timeline. I needed something that could handle the reality of how loans actually work.

For example, I needed to answer: "What if I add a $500 extra payment in March, start recurring $50 extra payments in June, and my rate adjusts in September - when will I actually be debt-free?" And then I wanted to duplicate that loan and test plan B, plan C, etc.

It's free and shows:
- Exactly when you'll be debt-free based on your payments
- How extra payments (with full control of when/how much) change your timeline and total interest
- Impact of rate adjustments (like when the Fed screws you over)
- Multiple payoff strategies (avalanche vs snowball)
- All your loans tracked in one place

Everything stays on your phone. No account, no ads, no BS.

**Here's the thing:** I'm not a financial expert. I just wanted to build the tool that shows you what the bank doesn't. I built this for MY situation, and I no longer have that terrible loan, but I want to make this useful for others dealing with their own debt nightmares.

**I need your help:**
- Does this actually solve a problem you have?
- What's missing that would make it more useful for YOUR loans?
- What kind of visibility do you need that other calculators don't give you?

Available on iOS and Android. I'm genuinely just trying to make something that helps people get out of the hell I was in.

Feel free to DM me if you want to talk through your specific loan situation - happy to help however I can.
